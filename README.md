The processes important to hurricane wave generation cover scales from kilometers to centimeters.  Within a storm, waves have complex spatial variations that are sensitive to hurricane size, speed, and orientation.  This makes it challenging to measure the spatial variability of hurricane waves with any one instrument.  To obtain both broad spatial coverage and resolve the full range of wave scales, we combine arrays of drifting wave buoys with airborne radar altimetry.  The microSWIFT (UW-APL) and Spotter (Sofar) buoys are air-deployed along a given storm track.  These buoys resolve the scalar wave frequency spectrum from 0.05 Hz to 0.5 Hz, which is approximately 600 m to 6 m wavelength (in deep water).  The Wide Swath Radar Altimeter (WSRA) flies into hurricanes aboard the NOAA Hurricane Hunter P-3s.  The radar altimetry data is processed to produce a 2D directional spectrum from 2.5 km to 80 m wavelength, and the radar backscatter provides an estimate of the mean square slope from centimeter wavelengths.  We use colocated observations from each instrument to create composite wave spectra with a larger range of wavelengths and better spatial coverage of observations.  In a related approach, we explore the use of the fully 2D spectra from the WSRA with the quasi-2D directional estimates from buoys (e.g., estimates from the first five spectra moments).  We also explore the dependence of mean square slope, which is a proxy for surface roughness, by combining the buoy slopes (meters) with the WRSA slopes (centimeters).  Together, the fusion of these wave instruments provides a multiscale view of the hurricane-generated waves.  These ocean surface waves are critical as drivers of the air-sea coupling that controls storm evolution and as drivers of coastal impacts by hurricanes.
